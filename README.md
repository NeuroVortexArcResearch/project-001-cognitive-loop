# Project #001 — Minimal Synthetic Cognitive Loop (v0.1)

### NeuroVortexArc Research

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Design and implement the smallest possible synthetic intelligence loop:

**Perception → Encoding → Memory → Internal State → Action**

This loop is the “mind kernel” from which more complex AGI-like architectures can evolve.

---

## 🧠 Core Questions  
- What is the simplest representation of perception?  
- How does information get encoded into a workable internal form?  
- How does a minimal memory unit behave?  
- What counts as internal state in such a tiny system?  
- What is the simplest meaningful action mechanism?
